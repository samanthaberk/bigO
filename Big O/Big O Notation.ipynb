    "***tldr;*** *Big O Notation is the way we describe how __efficient__ an algorithm is in terms of how much __time__ it takes to run and how much __space__ (in memory or on disk) it uses, relative to its input*\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Why express runtime and memory use in terms of Big O?**\n",
    "\n",
    "It's hard to say in certain terms the *exact* time or space an algorithm takes up, because this is subject to many variables like the speed of your processor, other programs the machine might be running, etc. So Big O notation is the \"good enough\" way we can describe an algorithm's efficiency by looking at how quickly the runtime and space used grows relative to the size of the input.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. How do we describe time and space \"relative to input\"?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we don't measure runtime and space directly, we can't express the speed in seconds or space in MB. Instead, we use the input the algorithm accepts, and describe as the input gets larger, how quickly the algorithm will grow. If the size of the input increases, will it take longer to run? Will it take up more space? How much more time/space will the algorithm need as the input increases? \n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Can't this get really complicated if the algorithm has a lot of steps?** \n",
    "\n",
    "Not necessarily. For big O analysis, we only really need to look at which parts of the algorithm will grow the fastest. So if you can pinpoint part of the algorthim that will grow the most as the input increases, you don't even have to look at other parts."
